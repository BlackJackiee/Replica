!!! warning
    [Argument limitations](https://create.roblox.com/docs/scripting/events/remote#argument-limitations)
    apply to `Replica.Data`, `Replica.Tags`, `Replica:FireClient()` and similar methods because
    Replica is based on RemoteEvents. [See official documentation for more information](https://create.roblox.com/docs/scripting/events/remote#argument-limitations).

Thorough API documentation will be released soon! Short documentation can be found at the top of `ReplicaServer.luau` and `ReplicaClient.luau` files.
Community tutorials for the older project "ReplicaService" may also help as Replica works similarly.
